# Noticeboard-Android-App
Noticeboard Android Application

To-do list (Added as going on holiday for 2 weeks. Needed to note down all ideas):
 - Order posts in descending order so the latest is first visible in the listview.
 - Added tab (my posts or edit my posts) on dashboard activity to display only posts by the logged in user, enabling them to remove them.
 - Update visuals of entire app
 - Push notifications when a new post has been made (only when account remains logged in potentially?)
 - Add last updated date & time for posts on the dashboard
